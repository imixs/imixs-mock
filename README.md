# imixs-test

The Imixs Workflow Test project provides an integration test suite to test differnt aspects from the Imixs Workflow engine. Tests provided in this project covering more complex test cases as provided by junit module tests.

The tests need a integration system. This is typical an instance of the current imixs worflow version. The dependencies of imixs-workflow-engine should be the same as the integration system. To setup a integration system the "Imixs Workflow Web Sample" can be used.

*Note:*
Please take care that you deploy the Imixs Workflow Web Sample app with the same imxis workflow engine as used by this test suite.
